# Carbon-Footprint-Estimator-from-Bank-Transactions

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project estimates the carbon footprint (COâ‚‚e) of users by analyzing their bank transaction data. Firstly, transactions were categorized and then spending behavior was analyzed, dividing users into tiers based on monthly COâ‚‚e levels (Good, Neutral, Bad). Machine learning models were then trained to predict COâ‚‚ emissions based on transaction amount, category, and subcategory.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Categorize transactions and calculate estimated COâ‚‚ emissions
- Segment users into COâ‚‚e tiers for eco-impact analysis
- Train ML models to predict COâ‚‚ emissions from new transactions
- Provide an interactive tool for real-time COâ‚‚e estimation

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- Languages: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data Processing
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Scikit-learn: Machine Learning models & evaluation
  - Joblib: Model Serialization
- Excel: Data annotation and analysis
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
 
## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Cleaned and categorized synthetic bank transaction dataset
- Tiering system based on monthly COâ‚‚ emission levels
- Multiple regression models with comparison (RÂ², MAE, RMSE, Max Error)
- Residual plots, predicted vs. actual plots, feature importance charts
- Interactive script to estimate COâ‚‚e from user input (amount, category, subcategory)
